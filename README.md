# Input  
The program collects user input via a `TextInput` field where users can enter a course they liked.

# Process  
The application uses `ScrollView` to display vertically scrollable content. Layout styles such as `alignItems` and `justifyContent` are applied through the `contentContainerStyle` prop to center content. A set of `Text` components organizes course listings into categories: Core Requirement, Depth of Study, Electives, and Capstone. Styles are managed via `StyleSheet` for consistent presentation.

# Output  
On screen, the app renders a centered image followed by structured headings and course lists. It presents academic program details clearly while enabling simple user interaction. The scrollable view ensures accessibility and responsiveness across devices.
