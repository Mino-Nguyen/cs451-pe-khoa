# Input
Users interact with the app through four main tabs: CitiesNav, AddCity, CountriesNav, and AddCountry. Inputs include city names, country names, and currency details, entered via text fields. Each new entry is captured and stored in the app’s state using unique identifiers generated by `uuid`.

# Process
The app uses React Native with tab and stack navigators to manage screen transitions. When a user adds a city or country, the corresponding handler (`addCity`, `addCountry`, or `addCurrency`) updates the state. Stack navigators allow nested navigation between list and detail views (e.g., Countries → Country). Props are passed to screens via the `children` prop, enabling dynamic rendering and data flow.

# Output
The app displays lists of cities and countries, along with their associated currencies. Users can view details by tapping on items, and newly added entries appear immediately. The UI updates in real time, reflecting the current state of the data.
